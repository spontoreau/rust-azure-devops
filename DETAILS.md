Rust ü¶Ä
===

This extension contains tasks that can be used to manage **Rust** projects.

**Rust** is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. For more information on **Rust**, take a look at the official [documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org).

## Rust Tool Installer

The extension adds the **Rust Tool Installer** task inside the **Tool** category. It installs **rustup** and the latest version of the **Rust** toolchain. Always ensure you have run this task first, others need it to run.

By default, the task will install the latest stable version. You can also install the **nightly** one by changing the advanced settings:

## Cargo

**Cargo** task is available in the **Build** category.

Parameters:

- **Command**: Cargo subcommand to execute (example: build, test, update, install, doc...).
- **Working directory**: Working folder that contains Cargo.toml (optional).
- **Options**: Subcommand options (optional).

## Other tasks

The extension also contains:

Those tasks can be used in the same way as the **Cargo** one.
